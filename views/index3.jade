	div.explanation
		dl
			dt What is it?
			dd We are a website focused solely on connecting up-and-coming breweries with quality, used equipment from larger establishments.
			br
			dt How does it work?
			dd Larger capacity breweries looking to sell their old equipment will find young brewery buyers here.
			br
			dt Is it secure?
			dd We provide a service that independently reviews the item for sale and vouches for its validity.
			br
			dt Why should I buy used?
			dd Breweries keep their equipment in good shape, lest the beer they produce become sub standard quality. Starting brewers will have cheaper overhead costs, the brewer can focus on what really matters- the beer.
